firefox-open-tabs-next-to-current
=================================

Open tabs that would normally be opened last next to the current one. Tabs that
are being re-opened and tabs that are opened by clicking on links in the
current tab are therefore not included. You can change the setting
`browser.tabs.insertRelatedAfterCurrent` in `about:config` if you want even the
latter to be opened right next to the current.
