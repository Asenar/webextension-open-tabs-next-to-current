firefox-open-tabs-next-to-current
=================================

Open all new tabs always to the right of the current one(which is not the same
as setting `browser.tabs.insertRelatedAfterCurrent` to true). This doesn't include
tabs that are being restored.

This add-on is developed using the [Mozilla Add-on
SDK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK).
