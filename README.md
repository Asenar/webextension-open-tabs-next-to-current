firefox-open-tabs-next-to-current
=================================

Open new tabs to the right of the current one(which is not the same as setting
`browser.tabs.insertRelatedAfterCurrent` to true). This doesn't include tabs
that are being restored. You can also disable this for clicks on the + button
in the tab bar(check addon preferences)

This add-on is developed using the [Mozilla Add-on
SDK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK).
